I just realized that I haven't posted anything on here in a few months.  Time really flies by too quickly.

First off, since my last post I bought a [beaglebone](http://beagleboard.org/bone) and set it up using [Arch Linux ARM](http://archlinuxarm.org/).
I then installed the basic stuff (openssh, mysql, php, etc) as well as [StatusNet](http://status.net/) microblogging software.  SN is federated social networking/micro-blogging software, which allows users to run their own nodes which can then be connected together rather seamlessly.  If one node goes down, the rest of the network is still up--hence the federation.
This beaglebone I setup to run my own uBlog node at [micro.jrobb.org](http://micro.jrobb.org), and it ran fine for a while.

Recently, though, I have begun to have issues, and now it is not working properly at all.  Since having these issues I have gone back to using [identi.ca](https://identi.ca), which is what I would say is the main node.
I'll have to fix up my beaglebone.

Alternatively, my cousin gave me an older Dell XPS400 desktop--she said to back up the stuff on it and then I can have the PC.
I may set this thing up as a server now, though it will definitely use quite a bit more power than the beaglebone would (it is a [PentiumD and the beaglebone is ARM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CPU_power_dissipation) ).  It's got a lot more RAM and would be a little speedier, certainly, though!

In other news, my family just got back from the beach--we went down for about a week.  It was a nice time, not too hot at all, but still warm.

That's all that I can think of at the moment.  I'm sure something else will come along...I've been thinking of getting a new PC (desktop or laptop...leaning towards laptop).  So that may be interesting.
