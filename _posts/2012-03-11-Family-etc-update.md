So I haven't really been on the computer much at home, so I don't think about posting and all that. Not that I really have much to post about, but here goes.

Yesterday the wife and I took the kids to the local Natural Science center. We had a lot of fun looking at the dinosaur (models and bones) and all of the real animals outside. Especially the tigers! The male tiger came right up to me (holding the baby) and pawed up and put his face on the glass, and kind of growled a little bit. It was awesome.

On another note, I will be turning 30 this year. I really don't like doing anything in particular for these type of events, but I guess this is kind of a big one. About 40% of my life will be done, scary thought.
Anyway, so my wife is planning a birthday party for me this year, with a Jimmy Buffet type summer theme. She'll be renting a giant adult water slide thing, one of the inflatable deals. Grilling out, some beer, grilling out (those are really the only 3 things I cared about anyway). Lots of friends will be invited. She's also getting some special made cookies and other things like that as party favors. Should be a good time.

What else is new? My son is potty trained now, and that's just amazing. It's nice to only have one kid in diapers again. I am not sure what it will be like to have NONE in diapers, or what it will be like when they are in school. Time really does fly.

This is why I never update this thing, I can't hardly complete a whole thought without a kid running around crying or wanting to be held or something. Never fails. :-/

OK. so my buddy Britt has been trying to make his own gong target to shoot at. A gong target basically consists of a stand, and then a hanging piece of steel (usually AR500). So far, the cost has been free, the frame is from some stuff he found, and he rigged it up in a pretty clever but simple construction--basically two tripods with a bar that hangs across the top. The piece of steel he got from a friend who had some scrap--it is 5/8" grade 80 hot rolled steel, which is a farcry from AR500 so we will have to see how it will do. And be very careful while doing it! We may have to build a shield structure out of some cinder blocks or something to hide from ricochets.
