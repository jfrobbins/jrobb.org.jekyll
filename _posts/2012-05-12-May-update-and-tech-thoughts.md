I'm not too great at the whole blogging thing. I think once upon a time it served a place and purpose, but these days my thoughts are so scattered and inconsistent they are more aptly captured by microblogging/social network type updates. Though when I get busy I don't think about doing that, either.

Work has been hectic as always, it not more so as of late. In addition to completely re-writing and vastly improving my spec report generating tool, lots of other normal day-to-day things take up a lot of time in addition to new tasks like ordering lots of new equipment and organizing/building new test benches. Lots going on.

I did manage to take yesterday off of work so I could take the family to the zoo. We had a good time, and did a lot of walking. The kids were asleep before we drove out of the parking lot at the end of the day. We had a lot of fun, and the weather was great--not too hot and sunny. We saw most of the animals, and got tickets to go see the anamatronic dinosaurs, which was pretty neat. The kids (and me too!) also got a kick out of the bee exhibit, where they had a lot of stuff about honey bees, and an actual hive with bees.

I upgraded my desktop computer to Fedora 17 beta, which is ok. Gnome 3 seems much improved, but the I've had a few problems in general. I rarely boot it up much anymore except for a few specific things or just to do updates, though. I've recently re-found love for my Acer A500 tablet. After that initial post, I stopped really seeing a purpose for the tablet and I stopped using it and didn't even charge it. However, a couple of months ago I charged it up, ran all the updates, and began using it again. Now I use it all the time. I took it with me on a business trip and used it for watching netflix. I also have a stream of news and web comics and things in my google reader, which the android app is great for. Google+ and facebook and the usual things like that. I love using the tablet now. Actually, I use it for probably 80% of my total home computing now, and this is one of the reasons that I rarely boot up the desktop. As long as I turn off the wifi when I am not using it, the battery will last for 2 or 3 days (or longer, maybe). I can watch videos, play games, and do a lot of web reading. Obviously, it is a tablet, so it is lacking in some areas--such as typing. I've been tossing around the idea of getting one of the docking stations and hooking a keyboard up to it, though, that would improve that experience.

Things are changing in technology and in the phone/tablet/computer space. In my opinion, wifi-only tablets and laptops will be going away as 4G networks expand and improve. This will likely force some kind of restructure in the cell service provider market, also. I would welcome better mobile type rates in place of using the dreaded time warner cable internet servcie--and on the 4G on my HTC thunderbolt I measured about the same download speeds as my home network (around 12Mbps). I feel that phones, tablets, laptops, and PCs will merge at some point down the line and there will be a big market for this. I would love for the one device that I carry everywhere to be able to do everything.

Microsoft is targeting the phone and tablet space with its new Windows 8 OS because it has to. That is the future of computing, so they had to jump on the bandwagon with Android and iOS. I haven't used it, but it looks nice. I still love android, though which for now seems to be the future for Linux at the moment. Tizen is coming along, and other Linux variants are or will be compatible with ARM processors so there will still be many options. Probably the herd will be thinned a bit, though, as time goes on.
Speaking of ARM, it's getting to be a pretty amazing architecture also!

This is an exciting time for technology (but...isn't it always an exciting time in technology??)

And those are my blurry thoughts on all of this at this point. :-)
