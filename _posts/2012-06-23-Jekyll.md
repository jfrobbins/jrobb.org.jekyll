I had found out about [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki) a year or two ago, but for some reason I had never implemented it.
I think I had originally asked [@bkuhn](http://identi.ca/bkuhn) about his website, and he pointed me towards Jekyll.

So now, I've actually gotten started using it, and I love it.  
It's not perfect, but pretty close.  No database, just simple static html.  The downsides being that there is no commenting system, and I will have to implement some kind of tag cloud. 
Neither of these are hard to do, the comments I can just use any public service (such as [identi.ca](http://www.identi.ca)), and there are several plugins for tags.
Oh, and I'll have to see about rss, too, but I imagine that's not a big deal either.

I can run 'jekyll --server' on my computer at home, and run a test to see how everything is generated.  Then it's just a simple rsync to bring my webserver up to date.  Very cool.

I do still need to write a script to go and convert all of the older blog posts, and I will do that when I have some free time.

That's about it for now.
