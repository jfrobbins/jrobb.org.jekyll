I have decided that I am not going to renew the factorq.net domain (again). I have not really used it recently, and truth be told, I prefer my jrobb.org domain. I have too many domains currently as it is.

factorQ.net won't ever be what it once was, and it was fun while it lasted, but now it is time to just let it go.
Now the problem is just....what to do about my email account there. dangit...I need to figure that one out in a hurry.

goodbye, old friend.
