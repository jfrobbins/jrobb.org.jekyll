#{{page.title}}

I am Jon.  I'm a programmer/free software enthusiast.  I love technology, and have since I first got my hands on a computer, which was around 1997 or '98. 

I also was an avid offroader/jeeper, but I have now sold my jeep and equipment.  I am most certainly not a lawyer or anything of that sort, so take anything I say with a grain of salt.  I only say my opinions, and they are mine and not those of my employer or anyone else.
