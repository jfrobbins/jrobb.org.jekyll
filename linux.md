##Last Update: 2012.06.19

My Currently running "everyday" distros:

* Main Desktop -- Fedora 17 Gnome3
* Wife's Nettop  -- Acer AspireOne Revo Nettop is also running OpenSuSE
* Android ICS -- On my <a href="http://jrobb.org/blog/?article=175">Acer A500</a> tablet

These are used less often:

* Linux Mint     -- Debian/testing. On my T42 laptop
* <a href="http://distrowatch.com/qimo">Qimo for kids</a>  -- eeePC that I let the kids play with

These are my favorite Linux distributions.  They are definitely subject to change!

1. <a href="http://distrowatch.com/fedora" target="_blank">Fedora</a> I like Fedora a lot--I've been using it on a couple of PCs here lately.
2. <a href="http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=suse" target="_blank">OpenSUSE</a>I think this is my new favorite. It is well put together and everything just works. 
3. <a href="http://distrowatch.com/crunchbang" target="_blank">CrunchBang</a> Crunbang is great, it is very clean and leightweight and openbox is fantastic
4. <a href="http://distrowatch.com/debian" target="_blank">Debian</a> This one was a runner up that I hadn't used, but I have been loving it.  I'm using the "testing" branch, and I have been very impressed with the stability.  The programs don't seem very old to me (a common complaint), but I think that mostly applies to the stable release.
5. <a href="http://distrowatch.com/arch" target="_blank">Arch</a> I love this one, I had been using it for a couple of years until my motherboard melted on my desktop. I miss it.
6. <a href="http://www.opensuse.org/en/" target="_blank">OpenSUSE</a> I like this one a lot, it seems very well put together and easy to use

A few more solid distros that deserve mention as runners up are:

* <a href="http://distrowatch.com/mint" target="_blank">Mint</a> Formerly based on Ubuntu, but now it is based on Debian testing. This is very well put together, and what I usually recommend to "n00bs" to GNU/Linux
* <a href="http://distrowatch.com/ubuntu" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> itself based on Debian. very polished. I used this one for a long time before hopping and eventually settling down with Arch
* <a href="http://distrowatch.com/aptosid">aptosid</a> (formerly sidux) based on Debian sid. I liked this one but not enough to stay with it for very long.
* <a href="http://distrowatch.com/sabayon" target="_blank">Sabayon</a> although a bit bloated on the default ISO, this distro and I really got along, and the community was top-notch.
* <a href="http://distrowatch.com/pardus" target="_blank">Pardus</a> this is definitely another good one.  I just didn’t “click” with it, but it was quality.
