        <id>http://jrobb.org/2012/06/23/Jekyll/</id>
        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had found out about &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; a year or two ago, but for some reason I had never implemented it.
I think I had originally asked &lt;a href=&quot;http://identi.ca/bkuhn&quot;&gt;@bkuhn&lt;/a&gt; about his website, and he pointed me towards Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, I've actually gotten started using it, and I love it.&lt;br/&gt;
It's not perfect, but pretty close.  No database, just simple static html.  The downsides being that there is no commenting system, and I will have to implement some kind of tag cloud.
Neither of these are hard to do, the comments I can just use any public service (such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.identi.ca&quot;&gt;identi.ca&lt;/a&gt;), and there are several plugins for tags.
Oh, and I'll have to see about rss, too, but I imagine that's not a big deal either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can run 'jekyll --server' on my computer at home, and run a test to see how everything is generated.  Then it's just a simple rsync to bring my webserver up to date.  Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do still need to write a script to go and convert all of the older blog posts, and I will do that when I have some free time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's about it for now.&lt;/p&gt;

        <id>http://jrobb.org/2012/06/09/Tablets-on-budget/</id>
        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've recently gotten a reborn love for my tablet, and I am actually thinking of getting a couple of cheaper models for my kids (so they will stop borrowing mine!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm going to put together a list of what I think are the tablets with the most bang for your buck in a couple of categories.  I will be using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com&quot;&gt;newegg&lt;/a&gt; for links, price comperison, specs and info.  Obviously you will want to shop around and do your own research first, and not just take my word on any of this--especially since the tech market is volatile and things get outdated very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple iPads are nice and all, but I am not including them in my comparison simply because I won't buy one.  Windows 8 tablets aren't out yet, but I prefer to stick to Android in any case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;10&quot; Tablets up-to $350&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834230018&quot;&gt;ASUS Eee Pad Transformer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tablet is still a good option even though it has an older processor (tegra2) and only 1GB of DDR2.  With a $339 price tag it is still a good contendor, and has the option for the dock so it can &quot;transform&quot; into a netbook.  This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834209001&quot;&gt;Moto Xoom&lt;/a&gt; has about the same specs (2x internal memory), but with a higher price tag.  This is my favorite for this category and price range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834322002&quot;&gt;Le Pan II Tablet PC Qualcomm APQ8060&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Wow, this tablet weighs in at $260, making it the cheapest of the bunch--by a pretty good margin!  Under the hood you will find the fastest CPU of this bunch at 1.2GHz, and it also uses a Qualcomm APQ8060 processor instead of a Tegra 2.  At this price point, you are bound to sacrifice something, and it looks like you get 8GB flash memory instead of 16, and a smaller resolution (1024x768), and less battery life (7 hrs).  This is a very good option if you're willing to accept the trade-offs for the price--seems like a good deal to me!

&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834215276&quot;&gt;Acer Iconia Tab A200-10g16u&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
This Acer is similar to the A500 that I have, and almost exactly the same specs as the above ASUS.  at $10 more, it is still a good option.
&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834127535&quot;&gt;SONY Tablet S SGPT111US/S&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
With a slightly smaller screen at 9.4&quot;, Sony apparently has a tablet in the same spec category as the above items.  I have not seen one of these myself, but it seems like a viable option.
&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834246292&quot;&gt;Lenovo ThinkPad 1830 (183822U)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Lenovo makes a pretty decent tablet, and this one is in the same price range at $350. 

&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16858726002&quot;&gt;LAVA-Tech QPad C-1010111&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Similar to the Le Pan above, but has a few more trade-offs--which could be expected at $220.  1024x600 resolution, and a measly 0.3MP front camera make this not a great option, but if the budget is tight then it is worth a look.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;10&quot; Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

In this category, it's a wash and will come down to aesthetics and user preference.  All of the specs are about the same, and the only thing that would sway me one way or another would be the existence of a standard USB port along with the micro HDMI, or the inclusion of ICS (though most of these are upgradable to ICS even if they come with honeycomb).  If you want a Tegra 3 (or newer) processor, you'll have to step up the pricing &gt; $350.
&lt;P&gt;
I think I would go with the Asus or Le Pan, personally.  The price on the Le Pan is just so tempting!


&lt;P&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;7&quot; Tablets &lt; = $130 (plus a Galaxy Tab and a lenovo)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834131287&quot;&gt;SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab 2 (7.0)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Samsung makes a nice tablet in their Galaxy line, and this is true in the 10&quot; category as well...they just tend to be pricey.  This 7&quot; model is $250, and it's really quality but I'm cheap so it won't be the queen of this 7&quot; ball.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834246233&quot;&gt;lenovo IdeaPad A1 (22282EU) &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
This Lenovo tablet isn't too far behind the Samsung in price.  A nice tablet with a TI OMAP cortex A8 CPU, decent resolution, 16GB SSD.  The downside that I see is it is running Gingerbread Android 2.3, and the price, obviously.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16858653009&quot;&gt;Aluratek AT107F&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
This tablet runs on an ARM iMAP CPU @ 1GHz, with 512MB memory, 4GB flash, AND comes with ICS. The resolution isn't the highest in this category at 800x480, but it is definitely decent for a 7-incher.  There is also a memory card slot, HDMI, and webcam which are all pretty standard.  Not bad for $130.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16858683003&quot;&gt;Iview 760TPC&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Another tablet right at $130.  This one has an ARM Cortex A8 CPU @ 1GHz, with 512MB memory and 8GB flash. It also has 800x480 resolution, and the standard mini HDMI, mini USB, and micro SD card slots.  2MP webcam as well, and states that the battery lasts up to 5 hrs of web browsing.  It coems with Android 2.3 Gingerbread, but it can be upgraded to 4.0 ICS from a download on the company's website.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16858736005&quot;&gt;Maylong M-285 Mobility&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
I'm not a huge fan of Maylong from the reviews that I have seen from their products, but the stats on this guy stand up to the rest in this category.  No reviews on newegg so I am not sure how it actually performs.  The Maylong comes with Android 4.0 ICS, a Cortex A* ARM CPU @ 1GHz, 800x480 resolution, 4GB flash, 512MB RAM, the wifis, mini usb, sd card slot, etc.  It does look to be lacking an HDMI port.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA10U08R7214&quot;&gt;WAN 7&quot; tablet PC with capacitive touch&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
This WAN tablet has some impressive specs, especially at $127.  Android 4.0 ICS, ARM cortex A8 at 1.2GHz.  800x480 (which is a bit weak), 8GB flash hard drive, 512 MB memory, and an sd card slot.  This one has an HDMI port and a miscellaneous webcam.  

&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16858501010&quot;&gt;Archos Arnova 7 G2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Archos has been making tablets for a long time, and they have always ranged from so-so to decent.  This one in particular comes with Android 2.3 (gingerbread), and has a resolution of 800x480, 4GB flash, mini USB, and 1GHz CPU.  It looks like it is missing HDMI out, GPS, and a webcam.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16858818009&quot;&gt;Refurb: Pandigital R80B400 Supernova media tablet 8&quot;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
This is a refub, but the the specs look alright, and the price is definitely there.  Also, this is an 8-incher.  
It comes with Android 2.3 (gingerbread), 800x600 resolution, 4GB flash, 512MB RAM, mini USB, micro HDMI, microsd card reader (up to 32GB), and a Samsung S5PV210 CPU (probably 1.2GHz).  This model got bad reviews on Amazon, I won't recommend it.  There is also a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16858818008&quot;&gt;7&quot; refurb model&lt;/a&gt; at $70.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834200478&quot;&gt;Refurb: DELL Streak 7&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
This DELL refurb runs Android 3.2 Honeycomb and has a 1GHz NVIDIA Tegra2 CPU, Corning Gorilla Glass, 800x480 resolution, 16GB flash, 512MB memory, SD card slot, dual webcams.  All that for $150.  Not too shabby.


&lt;h3&gt;7&quot; Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

The $130 price point is where it is at with 7&quot;, as far as I am concerned anyway.  There are also some &quot;open box&quot; options for some of these, which means you can grab one at a little better price.  As you can see, there are MANY viable options in this category, so do some research and preferably try a few out before you make a decision.  Feel free to leave any inputs in the comments (or where ever).  Also, when I am ready to make my purchase(s) I will update this article with which ones I wind up choosing.

&lt;P&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
So as you know, I'm cheap so I like getting a lot of bang for my buck.  The 7&quot; category is obviously where I am focused at the moment, but I listed the 10-inchers just for comparison and reference mostly.  
&lt;P&gt;

If I was buying a tablet for myself, I would probably go with a 10-12&quot; model.  And I would probably look for ones that come wiith 4G prepaid capability (not contract, I'm not about that on a tablet).  Although with tethering ability on my cell phone I would skip that and go wifi only.
&lt;P&gt;
Like I said, these days there are lots of options at a lot of different price points.  There are cheaper and more expensive options than what I have listed here, and some better or worse options--I've tried to list middle of the road sticking to my &quot;bang for the buck&quot; mantra, especially since I will be getting a tablet or two for my little kids soon.

&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;b&gt;update:&lt;/b&gt; a lot of new computers/laptops, tablets, and other hardware are coming out this summer which will drive prices down on previous model stuff, it would be wise to wait until late summer for a purchase, IMO

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have decided that I am not going to renew the factorq.net domain (again). I have not really used it recently, and truth be told, I prefer my jrobb.org domain. I have too many domains currently as it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;factorQ.net won't ever be what it once was, and it was fun while it lasted, but now it is time to just let it go.
Now the problem is just....what to do about my email account there. dangit...I need to figure that one out in a hurry.&lt;/p&gt;

        <updated>2012-05-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
        <id>http://jrobb.org/2012/05/12/May-update-and-tech-thoughts/</id>
        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm not too great at the whole blogging thing. I think once upon a time it served a place and purpose, but these days my thoughts are so scattered and inconsistent they are more aptly captured by microblogging/social network type updates. Though when I get busy I don't think about doing that, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Work has been hectic as always, it not more so as of late. In addition to completely re-writing and vastly improving my spec report generating tool, lots of other normal day-to-day things take up a lot of time in addition to new tasks like ordering lots of new equipment and organizing/building new test benches. Lots going on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did manage to take yesterday off of work so I could take the family to the zoo. We had a good time, and did a lot of walking. The kids were asleep before we drove out of the parking lot at the end of the day. We had a lot of fun, and the weather was great--not too hot and sunny. We saw most of the animals, and got tickets to go see the anamatronic dinosaurs, which was pretty neat. The kids (and me too!) also got a kick out of the bee exhibit, where they had a lot of stuff about honey bees, and an actual hive with bees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I upgraded my desktop computer to Fedora 17 beta, which is ok. Gnome 3 seems much improved, but the I've had a few problems in general. I rarely boot it up much anymore except for a few specific things or just to do updates, though. I've recently re-found love for my Acer A500 tablet. After that initial post, I stopped really seeing a purpose for the tablet and I stopped using it and didn't even charge it. However, a couple of months ago I charged it up, ran all the updates, and began using it again. Now I use it all the time. I took it with me on a business trip and used it for watching netflix. I also have a stream of news and web comics and things in my google reader, which the android app is great for. Google+ and facebook and the usual things like that. I love using the tablet now. Actually, I use it for probably 80% of my total home computing now, and this is one of the reasons that I rarely boot up the desktop. As long as I turn off the wifi when I am not using it, the battery will last for 2 or 3 days (or longer, maybe). I can watch videos, play games, and do a lot of web reading. Obviously, it is a tablet, so it is lacking in some areas--such as typing. I've been tossing around the idea of getting one of the docking stations and hooking a keyboard up to it, though, that would improve that experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are changing in technology and in the phone/tablet/computer space. In my opinion, wifi-only tablets and laptops will be going away as 4G networks expand and improve. This will likely force some kind of restructure in the cell service provider market, also. I would welcome better mobile type rates in place of using the dreaded time warner cable internet servcie--and on the 4G on my HTC thunderbolt I measured about the same download speeds as my home network (around 12Mbps). I feel that phones, tablets, laptops, and PCs will merge at some point down the line and there will be a big market for this. I would love for the one device that I carry everywhere to be able to do everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is targeting the phone and tablet space with its new Windows 8 OS because it has to. That is the future of computing, so they had to jump on the bandwagon with Android and iOS. I haven't used it, but it looks nice. I still love android, though which for now seems to be the future for Linux at the moment. Tizen is coming along, and other Linux variants are or will be compatible with ARM processors so there will still be many options. Probably the herd will be thinned a bit, though, as time goes on.
Speaking of ARM, it's getting to be a pretty amazing architecture also!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting time for technology (but...isn't it always an exciting time in technology??)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And those are my blurry thoughts on all of this at this point. :-)&lt;/p&gt;

        <updated>2012-03-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
        <id>http://jrobb.org/2012/03/11/Family-etc-update/</id>
        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I haven't really been on the computer much at home, so I don't think about posting and all that. Not that I really have much to post about, but here goes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the wife and I took the kids to the local Natural Science center. We had a lot of fun looking at the dinosaur (models and bones) and all of the real animals outside. Especially the tigers! The male tiger came right up to me (holding the baby) and pawed up and put his face on the glass, and kind of growled a little bit. It was awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On another note, I will be turning 30 this year. I really don't like doing anything in particular for these type of events, but I guess this is kind of a big one. About 40% of my life will be done, scary thought.
Anyway, so my wife is planning a birthday party for me this year, with a Jimmy Buffet type summer theme. She'll be renting a giant adult water slide thing, one of the inflatable deals. Grilling out, some beer, grilling out (those are really the only 3 things I cared about anyway). Lots of friends will be invited. She's also getting some special made cookies and other things like that as party favors. Should be a good time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What else is new? My son is potty trained now, and that's just amazing. It's nice to only have one kid in diapers again. I am not sure what it will be like to have NONE in diapers, or what it will be like when they are in school. Time really does fly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I never update this thing, I can't hardly complete a whole thought without a kid running around crying or wanting to be held or something. Never fails. :-/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK. so my buddy Britt has been trying to make his own gong target to shoot at. A gong target basically consists of a stand, and then a hanging piece of steel (usually AR500). So far, the cost has been free, the frame is from some stuff he found, and he rigged it up in a pretty clever but simple construction--basically two tripods with a bar that hangs across the top. The piece of steel he got from a friend who had some scrap--it is 5/8&quot; grade 80 hot rolled steel, which is a farcry from AR500 so we will have to see how it will do. And be very careful while doing it! We may have to build a shield structure out of some cinder blocks or something to hide from ricochets.&lt;/p&gt;
